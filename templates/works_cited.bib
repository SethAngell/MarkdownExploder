	abstract = {Remote rendering for VR is a technology that enables high-quality VR on low-powered devices. This is realized by offloading heavy computation and rendering to high-powered servers that stream VR as video to the clients. This article focuses on one specific issue in remote rendering when imperfect frame timing between client and server may cause recurring frame drops. We propose a system design that executes synchronously and eliminates the aforementioned problem. The design is presented, and an implementation is tested using various networks and hardware. The design cannot drop frames due to synchronization issues but may on the other hand stall if temporal disturbances occur, e.g., due to network delay spikes or loss. However, experiments confirm that such events can remain rare given an appropriate environment. For example, remote rendering on an intranet at 90 fps with a server located approximately 50 km away yielded just 0.002\% stalled frames while rendering with extra latency corresponding to the duration of exactly one frame (11.1 ms at 90 fps). In a LAN without extra latency setting, i.e., with latency equal to locally rendered VR, 0.009\% stalls were observed while using a wired Ethernet connection and 0.058\% stalls when using 5 GHz wireless IEEE 802.11 ac.},

	abstract = {Wireless virtual reality (VR) is predicted to become a killer application in 5G and beyond, which provides an immersive experience and revolutionizes the way people communicate. It is well-known that rendering is the key performance bottleneck in wireless VR systems, especially for VR games. However, real-time rendering and data correlation are ignored by most researchers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive VR framework that enables high-quality wireless VR in future mmWaveenabled wireless networks with mobile edge computing (MEC), where real-time VR rendering tasks can be ofﬂoaded to MEC servers adaptively and the caching capability of MEC servers enables further performance improvement. First, we formulate the addressed problem to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of the users, where association, adaptive ofﬂoading mode selection, and caching policy are jointly optimized. Considering the high complexity of the addressed problem, we then propose a distributed learning approach consisting of an ofﬂine training phase and an online running phase, which maintains scalability and adaptation capability. The ofﬂine phase is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) while the latter utilizes game theory. At last, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the other baseline algorithms in terms of QoE utility values, latency, and convergence time.},

The AR (Augmented Reality) technology is part of them. This one is considerate as a valid alternative of VR (Virtual Reality), which promises an improvement of teaching and learning experiences. This contribution aims to test the implementation of learning mobile technologies using AR on school education. Moreover, our interest is to find out which influence these technologies can have on children’s intrinsic motivation and their feeling of immersion.},
